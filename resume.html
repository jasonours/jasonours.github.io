            <h3>Who I am</h3>


            <div style='width:fit-content;line-height: 1.5rem'>My name is Jason Ours and I am a Licensed Practical
                Nurse. I have been a nurse for 14 years and have worked in many
                healthcare settings. I have been working as a Travel Nurse for the past six years. While traveling, I
                have worked in prisons (lots of prisons),
                on a Native American Reservation, and in a long term care facility. </div>
        </div>

        <div class='goals'>
            <h3>Where I am going</h3>

            <div style='width:fit-content;line-height: 1.8rem'> The part I love about nursing is that there is alway
                more to learn. It is for that reason that I am now back in school working
                towards becoming a Web Developer. My hope is that I will be able to take my knowledge as a nurse and
                merge it with the tech
                industry.</div>
